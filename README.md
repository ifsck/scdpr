# Spidercamp's Dog Pack Restoration

For many years Spidercamp's Dog Pack has remained never fully completed. There are several dog breeds mentioned either in the code or description but not available to use: beagles, Irish wolfhounds, and Newfoundlands. Beagles and Irish wolfhounds were mostly coded but graphics were never made, while Newfoundlands had graphics but no code. Since Mlie's Continued version is a faithful port of the original and doesn't add them, nor does the newer qux's Stray Dogs (rescued), I've taken it upon myself to fix at least Newfoundlands and Irish wolfhounds, as beagles were added with Vanilla Animals Expanded.
	
I've attempted to balance against vanilla and SDr, but that's not my forte, so if anything doesn't seem right, let me know and I'll make adjustments. Specifically, litter sizes in SCDP and SDr are comparatively massive, while I've gone closer to vanilla values. Also, crossbreeding with other dogs is enabled for these new breeds.
	
Currently only adds Newfoundlands, who while not quite as strong as some other big dogs, have sweet dispositions and are strong swimmers. So they will never attack on a failed taming change, nuzzle more often, and have a water movement speed of 90%. With Odyssey they gain the comfort trained ability.
	
Irish wolfhounds are not yet done.
		
Requires either SCDPc or SDr for the Newfoundland base texture.
